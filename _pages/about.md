I am a last-year PhD student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Hong Cheng](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-cheng-hong/). Prior to this, I received my masterâ€™s degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). During my time at UCAS, I was a member of [SIAT-NLP](https://github.com/siat-nlp) and was supervised by [Prof. Min Yang](https://minyang.me/). Currently, I am a visiting scholar at [NExT++](https://www.nextcenter.org/), National University of Singapore, working with [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and [Prof. See-Kiong Ng](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ngsk/). 

## Research Interest
My research interests are centered on advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on exploring trustworthy, human-centric Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications. Specifically, I focus on:
- **Conversational AI**
  Exploring areas such as **Conversational Recommender Systems**, **Target-Guided Dialogues**, and **Language Model-Powered Agents** to enhance interactive communication technologies.

- **Personalized LLMs**
  Investigating personalization aspects, including **personality modeling**, **role-playing**, **memory integration**, and ensuring **factual accuracy**, to tailor LLM outputs to individual user preferences.
